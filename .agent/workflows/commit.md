description: Check git status, stage files, and commit changes without user approval

// turbo-all

1. Run `git status` to check for modified files.
2. Run `git add .` to stage all uncommitted changes.
3. Generate a relevant commit message based on the changes (check `git diff --cached` if needed) and run `git commit -m "message"`.
